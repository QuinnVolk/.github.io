    <h2><b>The Heart Attack Grill - It's Approch to the Food Industry</b></h2>
    <h4>Prior to opening the heart attack grill in 2005, Jon Basso owned a number of gym and exercise buildings, where he would advise clients on their dietary and exercise needs. Jon Basso would then come to then release an article, including him stating <q>...it's disgusting because you are promising people things that are outside genetic possibility.</q> He would then state <q>...Instead of being a slimy, crooked, dishonest peddler of health and fitness services...I would actually launch a hamburger concept that would be obsolutly honest.</q> The first grill to be opened in Arizona included a front door sign stating <q>CAUTION, This establishment is bad for your health!</q> They would then later add a sign saying <q>CASH ONLY, because you might die before the check clears.</q> However, that would be nothing compared to the sign they would soon after put up saying <q>Anyone over 350lbs eats for FREE... All day, Every Day, Unlimted!</q> </h4>

    <h2>The Heart Attack Grill - It's Beggining to Fame</h2>
    <h4>The Heart Attack Grill's approach of their job applications were like no other. From questions asking if they had a inny or outy belly button, their opintion on certain conspiracies, and a comment stating <q>NO ONE gives a damn about your Acedemic Achievments, but if you want to bore us with them, go right ahead.</q> As the head of the restaurant, Jon Basso spends everyday dressed as a doctor while stating <q>We promote nicotine, alcohol, caffine, fat, cholesterol, sodium all the building blocks of a qualitym healthy good time.</q> These statements would then reach local news stations, creating the foundation of what the Heart Attack Grill would soon become. The Grill would then get 5-6 complaints on how the Grill calls their waitress's nurses, although, this would be a small price to pay givin the story was basically free advirtising. It would soon turn into further news coverage, where Jon explained in ways of how the grill might kill you. This unique approach to the food industry was like no other, with Jon going on to Fox News and talking about his grill, and how their website activity was surpassing mcdonalds. Although, this was before 2010, so websites werent nearly as popular as they are today. Jon Basso would then attempt to set the Guinness World Record for being the worlds unhealthiest restaurant, acheiving so with a incredable 9,982 calory burger, although this burger would be served with a side of tragedy.</h4>

    <h2>The Heart Attack Grill - Introducing Contraversy</h2>
    <h4>The Heart Attack Grill had introduced a spokesperson named Blare River, who stood at a staggering 6'8" and 570 pounds. He would appear in all of the resturants ads, stating how he eats for free all the time and that he loves it. In a news report, it stated how Blare felt more healthy then ever, however he passed away before the interview even aired. Even after this loss, the Grill still stook to their brutally honest branding, stating how Jon glorifies obesety and how it kills, with Jon taking this even further in a later interview stating how deaths from the Grill is great for business. Instead of the media lashing out on Jon like most people would expect, most people actually respected him for being so incredably honest, and how they didn't expect an apology from Jon since they can't blame him for people doing it to themselves. Jon Basso would then show his more pashinate side while stating <q>Some people think that Blares death is funny or deserved, but people who new him are crying their eyes out...Even if he was skinny, we would have givin him the job. We would have just put a fat suit on him. He just had personality.</q> As did the next spokesperson, Earny Heart who wouldn't last longer, although for a differnt reason.</h4>

    <h2>The Heart Attack Grill - What Comes Around, Goes Around</h2>
    <h4>In October, 2011, Jon moved the resturant to Los Vegas, also known as the land of poor choices. The new grill introduced a large wheight scale, including a sign saying "Fighting Anorexia since 2005!" The new location also lead to a new slogan, with a large increase in business and customers. The grill would then go on to shatter their last record burger by introducing it's 19 thousand calory burger. They were trying to generate media attention, and they succeeded. The burger would reach over 100 million veiws worth of exposure on youtube, with yourubers like Matt Stoney leaving the resturant in a wheelchair. Although there were athers who left the resturant in an ambulance.</h4>

    <h2>The Heart Attack Grill - Repeating History</h2>
    <h4>In 2012, there was an article released called <q>Man Has Heart Attack While Eating At The Heart Attack Grill</q>. This would happen again only a month later, where a woman collapsed inside the grill, marking the second person to fall victem to their horrible caloric foods in less then a year. But, Jon Basso saw this oputunity to brag about it on their website, stating how the coverage of these two incidents put money in his pocket, and how he enjoyed it. The Heart Attack Grill eventually got an unofficial third spokesperson named John Alleman who was recognized as the resturants most loyal customer. Jon Basso stated "He never missed a day, even on christmas. People just loved him. He connected with people in a real way." This would soon change on the 11th of February 2013. After eating his daily food at the grill, John Alleman suffered a heart attack and died while waiting at a bud stop right outside the grill. This would lead to Jon Basso's craziest stunt to date. While in an interveiw on ABS news, he would show how he kept John Alleman's creamation as "He wants you to know his food kills, so that maybe you'll stop eating junk." Most people on the internet state how they respected him for trying to make the world a healthire place, even if it risked his reputation. This would further be refined as Jon stated <q>anyone who is over 350 pounds gets free food. We applaud them, chreat them like a champ, make them feel good for a moment, give them all the food they want. But then when they get home at night and they ponder why they just got free food and why the whole resturant was applauding them, maybe because they are a freak, plain and simple."</q> More and more people starting to realize how the Heart Attack Grill was just just about its food, but it's about how people should stop eating junk and fast food. The grill was showing people what really happened if you eat so unhealthfully, and people respected Jon for it. Although, not everyone thinks it's a benafit.</h4>

    <h2>The Heart Attack Grill - Where it is Today</h2>
    <h4>Multiple celaberties came out about their thoughts about the grill, including how Anthony Bourdain thinks that the grill should be a war crime. A former emplyee announced her expeirence at the resturant, stating how at one point, a man passed out and instead of prioretizing to call medics, they pulled out their phones to record it so they could send it to the media. But, in a youtube video reviewing this resturant, an employee stated that she has been working there for 11 years, and how she has loved every moment of it, meaning that the expeirence really depends on the person who goes there. The PCMR would the send a letter to Jon that asked him to declare moral bankruptcy and close the grill, but from the nearly 6 million in revenue the grill has obtained, it looks like the grill won't be going anywhere, anytime soon.</h4>
